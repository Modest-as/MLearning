# Machine learning

## Description

Machine learning is quite fascinating subfield of computer science so I decided to learn more about it. This repository contains some of the code that I have written in order to introduce myself to various concepts of machine learning. 

Who knows, maybe one day this will become an open source machine learning library... It may not be the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) but this code should give you a basic understanding of the fundamentals. I will try to comment the code the best I can and give some basic theory behind the concepts in this README file.

Readers should be familiar with linear algebra and calculus.

## Multivariable Linear Regression

In statistics, [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) is an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X.

In a nutshell this means that for any two given data sets of points X and Y we are trying to find a relationship F such that F(x) = y where x represents the input state and y represents the output for the corresponding input state x.

We measure how well F(x) describes y using the cost function.
